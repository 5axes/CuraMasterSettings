# Cura Master Settings Guide

This Cura plug-in provides additional explanations with pictures and animations for many Cura settings. It's based on the exelent Plugin [SettingsGuide](https://github.com/Ghostkeeper/SettingsGuide#readme) developed by [Ghostkeeper](https://github.com/Ghostkeeper). But I have integrated somme additionnal articles relative to the [Cura Master Release](https://github.com/smartavionics/Cura).

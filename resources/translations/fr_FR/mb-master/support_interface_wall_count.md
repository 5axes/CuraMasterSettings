# Support Interface Wall Line Count

The number of walls with which to surround support interface. Adding a wall can make support print more reliably and can support overhangs better, but increases print time and material used.

This parameter can be subdivided into two applications, one for setting the [Support Bottom Wall line Count](support_bottom_wall_count.md), the other for the [Support Roof Wall line Count](support_roof_wall_count.md).

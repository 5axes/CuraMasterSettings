Brim Location
====
Print a brim on the outside of the model, inside, or both. Depending on the model, this helps reducing the amount of brim you need to remove afterwards, while ensuring a proper bed adhesion.

You can choose between the following options :

- Outside Only : Create a border only on the outside of a room.
- Inside Only : Create a border only on the inside of a room.
- Everywhere : Creating borders on the outside and inside

![Brim Inside Only](../images/brim_inside.svg)
![Brim Everywhere Only](../images/brim_everywhere.svg)

This option is only visible if the [Build Plate Adhesion Types](adhesion_type.md) is defined on **Brim**..

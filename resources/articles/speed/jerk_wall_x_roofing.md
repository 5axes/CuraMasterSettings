Top Surface Inner Wall Jerk
====

The "Top Surface Inner Wall Jerk" parameter controls the jerk specifically for the inner walls of the top surfaces of your print. Jerk determines the speed at which the printer changes direction. This setting allows you to adjust the jerk for the inner walls of the top layers, influencing the surface quality and structural integrity of your print.

Description:
--
- Lower Jerk: Reduces the jerk for the inner walls of the top surfaces, resulting in smoother movements and potentially improving surface quality.
- Higher Jerk: Increases the jerk for the inner walls of the top surfaces, which may reduce print time but can compromise surface quality and structural integrity.

Usage:
--

- Lower Values: Use lower values for improved surface quality and structural integrity on the top surfaces of your print.
- Higher Values: Increase the value for faster printing, sacrificing some surface quality and structural integrity.

Note: Adjusting this setting may require fine-tuning to achieve the desired balance between print speed and print quality.

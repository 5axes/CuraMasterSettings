Top Surface Inner Wall Speed
====

The "Top Surface Inner Wall Speed" parameter controls the printing speed specifically for the inner walls of the top surfaces of your print. This setting allows you to adjust the speed at which the inner walls of the top layers are printed, influencing the surface finish and structural integrity of your print.

Description:
--

- Slower Speed: Reduces the printing speed of the inner walls of the top surfaces, ensuring better surface quality and structural integrity.
- Faster Speed: Increases the printing speed of the inner walls of the top surfaces, which may reduce print time but can compromise surface quality and structural integrity.

Usage:
--

- Lower Values: Use lower values for improved surface quality and structural integrity on the top surfaces of your print.
- Higher Values: Increase the value for faster printing, sacrificing some surface quality and structural integrity.

Note: Adjusting this setting may require fine-tuning to achieve the desired balance between print speed and print quality.

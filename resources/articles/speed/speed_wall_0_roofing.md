Top Surface Outer Wall Speed
====

The "Top Surface Outer Wall Speed" parameter controls the printing speed specifically for the outer walls of the top surfaces of your print. This setting allows you to adjust the speed at which the outermost walls of the top layers are printed, influencing the surface finish of your print.

Description:
--

- Slower Speed: Reduces the printing speed of the outer walls of the top surfaces, resulting in higher quality surface finish and better detail.
- Faster Speed: Increases the printing speed of the outer walls of the top surfaces, which may reduce print time but can compromise surface quality and detail.

Usage:
--

- Lower Values: Use lower values for better surface quality and detail on the top surfaces of your print.
- Higher Values: Increase the value for faster printing, sacrificing some surface quality and detail.

Note: Adjusting this setting may require fine-tuning to achieve the desired balance between print speed and surface quality.

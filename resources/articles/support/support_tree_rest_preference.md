Rest Preference
====
The preferred placement of the support structures. If structures can't be placed at the preferred location, they will be place elsewhere, even if that means placing them on the model.

This is the desired location for the support structures. If the structures cannot be placed in the desired location, they will be placed elsewhere, even if this means on the model. The user can choose between:
* On buildplate when possible,
* On model if required

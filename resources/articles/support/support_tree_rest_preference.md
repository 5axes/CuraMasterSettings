Rest Preference
====

This is the desired location for the support structures. If the structures cannot be placed in the desired location, they will be placed elsewhere, even if this means on the model. The user can choose between:
* On buildplate when possible,
* On model if required


On buildplate when possible
----

In this case, the media will leave the printing plate if possible, without exceeding the limits imposed by the arborecent media creation parameters.
If it's not possible to reach the platen, then it's possible to have the media start from the part.


On model if required
----

If necessary, the brackets can be removed from the model.

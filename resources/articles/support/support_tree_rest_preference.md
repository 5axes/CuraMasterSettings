Rest Preference
====

This is the desired location for the support structures. If the structures cannot be placed in the desired location, they will be placed elsewhere, even if this means on the model. The user can choose between:
* On buildplate when possible,
* On model if required


On buildplate when possible
----

In this case, support can be created everywhere but as much as possible starting from the buildplate and in some case we can have some support starting from the model.


On model if required
----

In this case, support can be created everywhere and if required you can have support starting on the model. And Sometimes Required means they start on the model because you have more direct or simple support if you start on the model.

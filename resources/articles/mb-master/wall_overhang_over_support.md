# Ignore Support Below Overhangs


## description

When enabled, support is ignored and so overhangs over support are printed using overhanging wall settings.

The following settings are defined in [fdmprinter.def.json](https://github.com/smartavionics/Cura/blob/mb-master/resources/definitions/fdmprinter.def.json) : wall_overhang_over_support

# Infill Fan Speed Override

When enabled, the print cooling fan speed is altered for the infill. Using a reduced or even zero fan speed when printing infill can make the part stronger. The new value for the fan speed is defined by the option [Infill Fan Speed](infill_fan_speed.md).

The following settings are defined in [fdmprinter.def.json](https://github.com/smartavionics/Cura/blob/mb-master/resources/definitions/fdmprinter.def.json) : infill_fan_enable

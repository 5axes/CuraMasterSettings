Print the skin lines monotonically. This may improve the visual quality of the skin. Only applied when the 'Lines' [skin pattern](../top_bottom/top_bottom_pattern_lines.md) is used.

The following settings are defined in [fdmprinter.def.json](https://github.com/smartavionics/Cura/blob/mb-master/resources/definitions/fdmprinter.def.json) : monotonic_skin_lines

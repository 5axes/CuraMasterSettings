# Mesh Temperature Delta

The nozzle temperature used for the current mesh is increased by this amount. Negative values reduce the nozzle temperature.

This parameter is mainly used as a specific parameter to be specified on a selected mesh. It allows in this way for prints with several parts to define a different temperature for the parts.

The following settings are defined in [fdmprinter.def.json](https://github.com/smartavionics/Cura/blob/mb-master/resources/definitions/fdmprinter.def.json) : mesh_temperature_delta

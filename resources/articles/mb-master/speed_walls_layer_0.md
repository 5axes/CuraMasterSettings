# Initial Layer Wall Speed


# speed_walls_layer_0 description
The speed used to print walls in the initial layer. Reducing this speed may increase adhesion to the build plate while still allowing the skin areas to be printed at a faster speed.


# acceleration_walls_layer_0
Initial Layer Wall Acceleration


# acceleration_walls_layer_0 description
The acceleration during the printing of walls in the initial layer.


# jerk_walls_layer_0
Initial Layer Walls Jerk


# jerk_walls_layer_0 description
The maximum instantaneous velocity change during the printing of walls in the initial layer.

The following settings are defined in [fdmprinter.def.json](https://github.com/smartavionics/Cura/blob/mb-master/resources/definitions/fdmprinter.def.json) : speed_walls_layer_0

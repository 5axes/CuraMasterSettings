# Infill Vertical Scaling


## Description
Scales the vertical infill pattern. Values larger than 100% stretch the pattern, values less than 100% compress the pattern. Note that some infill patterns do not work well with scaling values that differ greatly from 100%.

The following settings are defined in [fdmprinter.def.json](https://github.com/smartavionics/Cura/blob/mb-master/resources/definitions/fdmprinter.def.json) : infill_scaling_z

# Initial Fan Speed at Layer

This paramater defines the layer at which the fans spin at [Initial Fan Speed](../cooling/cool_fan_speed_0.md). If [Regular Fan Speed at Height](../cooling/cool_fan_full_at_height.md)  is set, this value is calculated and rounded to a whole number.

The following settings are defined in [fdmprinter.def.json](https://github.com/smartavionics/Cura/blob/mb-master/resources/definitions/fdmprinter.def.json) : cool_fan_min_layer

Gradient Infill Speed Scheme


# gradient_infill_speed_scheme description
The speed modification scheme to use when printing gradient infill. Fast alters the print speed to keep the extrusion rate constant, the print speed can both increase and decrease. Slow is similar except the print speed can only decrease. On flow change reduces the print speed where the infill flow is changing.


# gradient_infill_type option none
None


# gradient_infill_type option constant_fast
Fast


# gradient_infill_type option constant_slow
Slow


# gradient_infill_type option flow_change
On Flow Change


# gradient_infill_speed_factor
Gradient Infill Speed Factor


# gradient_infill_speed_factor description
Scales the effect the infill speed scheme has on the print speed.


# gradient_infill_dist
Gradient Infill Distance

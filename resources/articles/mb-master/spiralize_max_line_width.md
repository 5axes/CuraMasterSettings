# Maximum Spiralized Line Width

The maximum width of a spiralized contour line as a percentage of the normal line width. Setting this to a value greater than 100 enables variable width spiralized contours.

This value is valid only if the [Spiralize the outer contour](../blackmagic/magic_spiralize.md) is enabled.


The following settings are defined in [fdmprinter.def.json](https://github.com/smartavionics/Cura/blob/mb-master/resources/definitions/fdmprinter.def.json) : spiralize_max_line_width

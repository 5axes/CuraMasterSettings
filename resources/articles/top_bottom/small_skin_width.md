Small Top/Bottom Width
====
Small top/bottom regions are filled with walls instead of the default top/bottom pattern. This helps to avoids jerky motions. Off for the topmost (air-exposed) layer by default (see 'Small Top/Bottom On Surface').

Small Top/Bottom Width reduces jerky motions in small top/bottom surfaces, with Small Top/Bottom On Surface you can exclude the setting on the surface by activating or not the option [Small Top/Bottom Width](small_skin_on_surface.md).

Hole Horizontal Expansion Max Diameter
====
When greater than zero, the Hole Horizontal Expansion is gradually applied on small holes (small holes are expanded more). When set to zero the Hole Horizontal Expansion will be applied to all holes. Holes larger than the Hole Horizontal Expansion Max Diameter are not expanded.

To be visible, the [Horizontal expansion of holes](hole_xy_offset.md) option must have a value other than Zero.
